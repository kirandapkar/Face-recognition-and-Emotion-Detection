HOW TO RUN CODE:-<br/>
**********NOTE: <input_images> should contain only 1 face ***********<br/>
For face recognition:<br/><br/>
<br/>
NOTE: Please refer to lines 16 and 36 in 'test.py' before running the code<br/>
'python3 test.py <input_image> <2/3/4>'<br/>
<br/>
A file named 'trainingDatax.xml' (where x = 2/3/4) which can be used for subsequent runs.<br/>

OUTPUT will be an image with rectangle drawn around face and on top it, its label if labelled with confidence <=120<br/>
<br/>    For emotion recognition:
<br/>
NOTE: Training has already been done. Just run the code in 'emotionRecognition.py' with an input<br/>
'python3 emotionRecognition.py <input_image>'<br/>
<br/>
OUTPUT will be 2 windown one with rectangle drawn around face in input image, other contains probabilites of different emotions
